| Short         | Turn this on to quiet new position reporting by the adjusters, |
|               | and also adjuster reporting when clicked. PosDump will still   |
|               | report all positions/rotations.                                |

Like the above option, quietAdjusters option is one of those options I think is
very valuable. Consider when adjusting a couples set. First adjust position for
one sitter, then change seats to the other and adjust that position. If
quietAdjusters is turned off, local chat is spammed by a line each time the
adjuster is moved. It becomes a difficult task to copy the correct line to paste
into the notecard at the correct place. In the end, it becomes much more
convenient to click Pose Dump and get all the positions within the card at once
(in the right order) for copy/paste. This alone makes it much nicer to turn on
quietAdjusters and not be confused about which line is the one needed. Consider
adjusting the positions in 4 notecards before saving them, with quietAdjusters
turned off finding the correct line for each card would be almost impossible,
but with quietAdjusters adjusters turned on and clicking Pose Dump when finished
with each card then there are only 4 dumps in local to pick from.
