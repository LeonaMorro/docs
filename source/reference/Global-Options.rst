Global Options
--------------

There are some options to set up how nPose will react in certain situations.
These Options are mostly global settings and once they are set will rarely need
to be changed for a specific nPose build. You can set this global option from
within any Notecard (best practice: set the from within the .init Notecard) with
the :ref:`c_OPTION` command.
