.. _c_PAUSE:

PAUSE
^^^^^

The syntax is as follow:

* ``PAUSE|pauseTime``

This pause is more of a global pause and will halt nPose execution of the
remaining items within the notecard for the duration of the pauseTime.

.. note::
   Try hard to avoid this command (it is evil), use the :ref:`c_TIMER` command
   instead.
