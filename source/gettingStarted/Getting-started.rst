Getting started
===============

To follow this small tutorial you need **nPose V3.10**.

If you got nPose v3.10 inworld, you have to unpack it (Rezz the objects that
have "~ boxed" in their names and click them).

This document assumes that you have a basic understanding of editing and
adjusting objects in world. This document also assumes that you have unpacked
nPose Release and can be found in your inventory. If not, the latest release
can be found either on marketplace for free or at nPose HQ.
